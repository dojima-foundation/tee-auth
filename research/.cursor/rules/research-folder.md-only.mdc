# Research Folder Rules

The `research/` folder is restricted to **markdown files only** (`.md` extension).

## File Type Restrictions
- ✅ **Allowed**: `.md` files (markdown documents)
- ❌ **Not Allowed**: Any other file types including:
  - PDF files (`.pdf`)
  - Text files (`.txt`)
  - Word documents (`.doc`, `.docx`)
  - Images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, etc.)
  - Any other file extensions

## Purpose
This folder is intended for research documentation and notes in markdown format only. All research materials should be converted to or written in markdown format for consistency and version control compatibility.
