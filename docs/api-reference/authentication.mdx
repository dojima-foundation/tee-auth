# Authentication

All requests to the TEE Auth API require authentication using the X-Stamp header, which contains a cryptographically signed request.

## API Keys

To authenticate with the API, you need an API keypair (public/private) for signing requests.

### Creating API Keys

You can create API keys using the `/public/v1/submit/create_api_keys` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/public/v1/submit/create_api_keys" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Stamp: YOUR_STAMP" \
  -d '{
    "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_API_KEYS_V2",
    "timestampMs": "1625097600000",
    "organizationId": "your_organization_id",
    "parameters": {
      "userId": "your_user_id"
    }
  }'
```

## Request Signing

Each request must be signed using your private key. The signature is included in the X-Stamp header.

### Signing Process

1. Create a request object with the required fields
2. Serialize the request to JSON
3. Sign the serialized request using your private key
4. Include the signature in the X-Stamp header

## Common Request Structure

All API requests follow this common structure:

```json
{
  "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_*",
  "timestampMs": "timestamp_in_milliseconds",
  "organizationId": "your_organization_id",
  "parameters": {
    // endpoint-specific parameters
  }
}
```

## Required Headers

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Content-Type | application/json |
| X-Stamp | Cryptographically signed request |

## Error Responses

Authentication errors will return a 401 Unauthorized status code with an error message in the response body.
