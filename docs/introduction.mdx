# TEE Auth

TEE Auth is a secure authentication and transaction signing service that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide enhanced security for cryptographic operations.

## Features

- **Secure Key Management**: Store and manage cryptographic keys in secure enclaves
- **Transaction Signing**: Sign transactions securely within TEEs
- **API Key Management**: Create and manage API keys for authentication
- **Activity Approval**: Approve activities through secure channels
- **Authenticator Management**: Create and manage authenticators

## Architecture

TEE Auth consists of two main components:

1. **gauth**: The authentication and API service written in Go
2. **renclave-v2**: The TEE enclave service written in Rust

Together, these components provide a secure and scalable solution for managing cryptographic operations in a trusted environment.
