# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get started with TEE Auth quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.19 or later (for development)
- Rust 1.68 or later (for development)

## Installation

### Using Docker

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dojima-foundation/tee-auth.git
cd tee-auth

# Start the services
cd gauth
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Setup

For manual setup, follow these steps:

1. Set up the renclave-v2 service:

```bash
cd renclave-v2
make build
```

2. Set up the gauth service:

```bash
cd gauth
cp env.example .env  # Configure your environment variables
go build ./cmd/server
./server
```

## Making Your First API Call

### Authentication

All API calls require authentication using the X-Stamp header:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/public/v1/submit/approve_activity" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Stamp: YOUR_STAMP" \
  -d '{
    "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_APPROVE_ACTIVITY",
    "timestampMs": "1625097600000",
    "organizationId": "your_organization_id",
    "parameters": {
      "activityId": "your_activity_id"
    }
  }'
```
