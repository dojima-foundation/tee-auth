2. [TEE Instance Management](./tee-instances.md) - Single and multi-instance TEE setup
3. [Key Management](./key-management.md) - All key types and their purposes
4. [TEE-to-TEE Key Sharing](./tee-to-tee-sharing.md) - Secure key sharing between TEEs
5. [Encryption & Decryption](./encryption-decryption.md) - Untrusted data handling

### Technical Documentation
6. [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) - System architecture and file structure
7. [API Reference](./api-reference.md) - Complete API documentation
8. [Testing Guide](./testing-guide.md) - Comprehensive testing procedures

### Key Features Covered
- **Genesis Boot**: Quorum-based key initialization with configurable thresholds (2-out-of-3, 7-out-of-7, etc.)
- **TEE Instances**: Single and multi-instance TEE management with Docker containers
- **Key Types**: Quorum keys, member keys, ephemeral keys, attestation keys, and seed generation keys
- **Key Sharing**: Secure TEE-to-TEE communication with manifest sharing, attestation, and key transfer
- **Encryption**: ECIES, AES-256-GCM, HKDF, and P-256 digital signatures for untrusted data
- **Architecture**: Complete system overview with file structure and component relationships

## Quick Start

For a quick overview of the system:
- Start with [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) to understand the system
- Read [Genesis Boot Process](./genesis-boot.md) for initial setup
- Follow [TEE Instance Management](./tee-instances.md) for multi-instance scenarios
- Use [API Reference](./api-reference.md) for implementation details

## System Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Rust 1.70+ 
- Linux environment with KVM support
- Hardware TEE support (Intel SGX or AMD SEV)
